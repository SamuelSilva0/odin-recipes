        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>SAUCE: In a pan put the tomato paste, water, oregano, basil, dehydrated garlic, dehydrated onion, salt and cook over low heat until it begins to boil. Add the parmesan and mix very well.</li><hr>

            <li>DOUGH: In a bowl put the warm water, olive oil, sugar, dry biological yeast and mix well. Cover with a cloth and let rise for 20 minutes.</li><hr>

            <li>Add the wheat flour, salt and mix very well, as soon as the dough is difficult to work with, place it on the counter and start kneading for at least 20 minutes or until the dough 
                is very smooth and elastic. If your dough is too soft, you can add more wheat flour, if you feel it is too dry,you can add more water! It's important to feel the dough 
                and see what it asks for.</li><hr>

            <li>Place the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise for at least 40 minutes. (tip: oven with the light on is great)</li><hr>

            <li>Sprinkle cornmeal in a 33cm pizza mold and open the dough with your hands, making it thinner in the center and with thicker edges.</li><hr>

            <li>Place the sauce (already cold), cover with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni and cover with a cloth and let rise for 20 minutes.</li><hr>

            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven for about 20 minutes at a very high temperature, here I used 250°c, when you put the pizza 
                in the oven, lower the oven to 230°C and let the pizza bake until the dough is golden and the cheese also!</li>
